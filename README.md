ZIP Writer extension helps you easily convert your file(s) to a single compressed file (.zip).

Simply drag & drop files to a designated area in the app UI (top section). All the uploaded files will be listed in the UI. You can now click on the - Download ZIP file - button in order to download the ZIP file to your system (default download location). There is also a reload button at the top left corner in the app UI. Clicking on this button will reload the app and reset all active operations. If you want to zip multiple files, please drag & drop them altogether in the app (top section). It is also necessary to reload the UI after each zip operation.

Note 1: this add-on is only designed to make compressed zip files. If you want to extract a zip folder (unzip), please install my other add-on: ZIP Reader (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zip-reader/hppjaadfhhgadeokjndmbnjnegagcadd)

Note 2: this add-on is using an open-source JavaScript library for the unzip operation. You can get more info about this library here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/zip.js
